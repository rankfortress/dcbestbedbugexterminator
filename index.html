	Bed bugs can be in your cabinets, in your mattress, closets, lamps, paintings, cracks, window seals, small crevices, under tables, and in your furniture. This is a fact. The problem with bed bugs is that they are so small that you can’t see them. If you can’t see them, then you can’t address the problem before they begin to spread. This is why we will do a thorough inspection to determine how extensive your bed bug problem is. You can be sure that if there are bed bugs, we will find them.
